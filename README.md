# Cardiac Coherence
This is my project for PP2. It is a one-page informative website on the subject of cardiac coherence. I am an adept of this breathing technique and I want to present it in a simple and concise way to Internet users.

SCREENSHOTS WEBSITE RESPONSIVE

## Wireframes
I would like a one-page website because I don't have a lot of content so it's not wise to have several pages for a few informations. So the user only has to scroll on the page to see all the information. 

## Features

My site has only one page. The user can find illustrations, interactive elements as well as informative text.My page is divided into several sections:

- __What is Cardiac Coherence__
This part briefly explains what cardiac coherence is. Without going into details, the user can find general information about this breathing technique.

- __3 important numbers__
Here the user can learn about 3 very important numbers in cardiac coherence which are: 365. This is a technical way to remember how to practice cardiac coherence. 365 days in the year for a daily practice but especially 3 times a day, 6 breaths per minute, 5 minutes duration. 

- __Health Benefits__
This section lists some of the recognized benefits of the daily practice of cardiac coherence.

- __How is it working?__
This section goes into the details of the practice. The user will be able to know exactly how to perform cardiac coherence independently. A video is also available, which the user can watch directly on the page. The video does not start automatically. 

### Existing Features

- __header__
My header displays the website logo. There is no navigation or link on the logo as this is a single page site.

- __footer__
The footer displays the copyright with my name and the current year. This functionality is realized with a JavaScript script.
There are also the logos of my GitHub and LinkedIn accounts. Both links open in windows external to the site.
