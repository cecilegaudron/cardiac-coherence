            <h1>Discover the cardiac coherence</h1>
            <p>Cardiac coherence is a breathing technique that aims to immediately decrease the heart rate in a particularly stressful situation. You can be fully involved in the regulation of your emotions in just 15 minutes a day.</p>

        <div class="introduction">
            <h2>What is it ?</h2>
            <p>It is a method like a “physiological balance” that comes to regulate the heart rate with our emotions. It aims to practice voluntary breathing, which will allow soothing of anxiety. The heart will then echo the breath, harmonizing with it.
                It is at the intersection between relaxation and biofeedback (which is the rehabilitation of behavior through awareness of physiological reactions). The main objective of practicing cardiac coherence is to bring about a rapid calming.</p>

            <h2>How is it working ?</h2>
            <p>In a global way, it will allow a better management of its emotions, consequently to decrease, in a notable way, daily stress and anxiety. 15 minutes per day of cardiac coherence can then increase your quality of life.</p>
            <p>The immediate effects of cardiac coherence last approximately 3 to 6 hours. Therefore, it is estimated that the time between practices is 4 hours apart.</p>
            <p>It's very simple!
                Just find a quiet place where you won't be disturbed and sit down, on a chair or a floor, with your back straight.
                A breath is composed of an inhalation and an exhalation. Each of them must last 5 seconds. For this you can use a watch, an application or the animation below. 
                It is advisable to use abdominal breathing and therefore to breathe through the belly. It is possible to breathe through the nose and/or the mouth. Find your way to practice cardiac coherence. The important thing is that you feel good.</p>
