            <h1>Discover the cardiac coherence</h1>
            <p>Cardiac coherence is a <strong>breathing technique</strong> that aims to immediately <strong>decrease the heart rate in a particularly stressful situation</strong>.<br><br>
                You can be fully involved in <strong>the regulation of your emotions in just 15 minutes a day</strong>.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="introduction">
            <h2>What is it ?</h2>
            <p>It is a method like a “physiological balance” that comes to regulate the heart rate with our emotions.<br><br>
                It aims to practice voluntary breathing, which will allow soothing of anxiety.<br><br>
                <strong>The heart will then echo the breath, harmonizing with it.</strong><br><br>
                It is at the intersection between relaxation and biofeedback (which is the rehabilitation of behavior through awareness of physiological reactions). <br><br>
                The main objective of practicing cardiac coherence is to <strong>bring about a rapid calming</strong>.</p><br><br>
            <p>In a global way, it will allow a <strong>better management of its emotions</strong>, consequently to decrease, in a notable way, <strong>daily stress and anxiety</strong>. <br><br>
            <p>The immediate effects of cardiac coherence last approximately <strong>3 to 6 hours</strong>.</p>

        <div class="doing-it">
            <h2>How is it working ?</h2>
            <p>It's very simple!<br><br>
                Just find a <strong>quiet place</strong> where you won't be disturbed and sit down, on a chair or a floor, with your back straight.<br><br>
                A breath is composed of an inhalation and an exhalation. Each of them must <strong>last 5 seconds</strong>.<br><br>
                For this you can use a watch, an application or the animation below.<br><br>
                It is advisable to <strong>use abdominal breathing</strong> and therefore to breathe through the belly. It is possible to breathe <strong>through the nose and/or the mouth</strong>. Find your way to practice cardiac coherence. The important thing is that you feel good.</p>
